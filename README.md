# Shelf Enabled Global NEMO (SE-NEMO) TIDES BRANCH

**_\*\* NB the code as it stands is a placeholder - not intended for use - the setup script has been tested and will checkout, compile and run the ORCA025 (NEMO 4.0.2) code on ARCHER, but namelists and forcing files are yet to be configured for the 'Shelf Enabled' part_**

# TIDES BRANCH
This branch includes tides and relevant modifications. These modifications are outlined in MY_SRC/README.md.

Configuration files for SE-NEMO project

## Quick Start:

```
git clone git@github.com:NOC-MSM/SE-NEMO.git
./SE-NEMO/scripts/setup/se-orca025_setup_archer -w $PWD/test -x $PWD/test -s $PWD/SE-NEMO
cd test/nemo/cfgs/se-orca025/EXP00
```
Edit the project code in  `runscript.pbs` then:
```
qsub runscript.pbs
```
This will produce a 5 day mean output from the beginning of 1958. The run should take 15 minutes to complete once in the machine.

### Forcing data:

[SE-ORCA025](http://gws-access.ceda.ac.uk/public/jmmp_collab/)

_this is automatically transferred when the setup script is executed_

### Important:

The `MY_SRC_GO8_FROZEN` directory should only contain the re-ROSEd code from G08. If editing any of these routines, copy the file from `MY_SRC_GO8_FROZEN` to `MY_SRC` and edit it there. The build process will copy the contents of `MY_SRC_GO8_FROZEN` to `cfgs/se-nemo/MY_SRC` before copying `MY_SRC` to `cfgs/se-nemo/MY_SRC`. Any files with the same name will be overwritten.

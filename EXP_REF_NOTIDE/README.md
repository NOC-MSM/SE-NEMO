This directory contains the files that Alex used for his REF (no tide) simulation on MONSOON of GO8p5/GSI9, or NEMO v4.0.3, with the equation of state set to TEOS10 (hence the changed T & S variable names). It is forced with DFS5.2 from 1976 to 2015.

Note that the namelist files should be compared against future expts. and justification for choice of different parameters should be documented in the appropriate individual page of the wiki.

Also, the XML files may be helpful to ensure that diagnostics are the same, especially important for bottom pressure, where real8 is crucial to preserve the signal.
